## Telegram Mode A / INBOX State

| Item | State |
|------|-------|
| Telegram workflow | Inactive — no Schedule Trigger |
| D-0173-A | Decided = 3 (task 0177, 2026-05-13) — schedule deferred; implement idempotency first |
| D-0180-A | Decided = 1 (task 0182, 2026-05-13) — idempotency/state-store runtime gate opened |
| D-0187-A | **Decided = 1** (batch 0188–0190, 2026-05-14) — duplicate-skip validation gate open for exactly one manual run |
| Idempotency design | Exists: `docs/automation/telegram-notifier-idempotency-state-store-implementation-design.md` |
| Idempotency checklist | Exists: `docs/automation/telegram-notifier-idempotency-implementation-checklist.md` |
| Runtime UI handoff | Exists: `docs/automation/telegram-idempotency-runtime-ui-handoff.md` (task 0183) |
| Data Table | `alina_telegram_notifier_state` — created and one row written (user report 2026-05-14) |
| Idempotency implementation | Done by user report (2026-05-14) — send/write test succeeded; duplicate-skip not yet validated |
| Token / chat id in repo | None |
| INBOX pending count | 0 |
| INBOX decided count | 12 |
| Next step | Perform exactly one duplicate-skip validation run (expected: false branch, no Telegram, no new state row) |
