## Task State

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Last completed | 0203 — batch (0199–0203) docs-only (2026-05-14): 0199 recorded D-0197-A pinned validation not successful (TRUE branch / Telegram arrived / Store wrote task 0198 not 0193 / partial pinning insufficient); 0200 documented root cause (partial override does not prevent downstream dynamic references); 0201 created fully-pinned harness design; 0202 created D-0202-A pending (inspection/repair, no Execute); 0203 propagated state updates; D-0197-A moved to Decided (= 1, not successful); D-0202-A pending; duplicate-skip remains NOT conclusively validated; next valid step = controlled harness inspection/repair (no Execute); workflow inactive/manual-only; no Schedule Trigger; no token/chat id in repo; INBOX: 1 pending (D-0202-A), 15 decided |
| Queue | `docs/tasks/queue/` |

## n8n Runtime

## Telegram Mode A / INBOX State

| Item | State |
|------|-------|
| Telegram workflow | Inactive — no Schedule Trigger |
| D-0173-A | Decided = 3 (task 0177, 2026-05-13) — schedule deferred; implement idempotency first |
| D-0180-A | Decided = 1 (task 0182, 2026-05-13) — idempotency/state-store runtime gate opened |
| D-0187-A | **Decided = 1, consumed/inconclusive** (batch 0188–0190, 2026-05-14; result recorded batch 0191–0193) — duplicate-skip validation gate opened, one run executed, result inconclusive due to latest-done drift |
| D-0193-A | **Decided = 1, consumed/inconclusive** (batch 0194–0198, 2026-05-14) — retry applied per user's prior conditional order; runtime TRUE branch / Telegram arrived / likely new-key send due to latest-done drift; NOT a confirmed idempotency bug |
| D-0197-A | **Decided = 1, not successful** (batch 0199–0203, 2026-05-14) — one manual pinned run executed; override node output correct for 0193; but downstream nodes used dynamic values; `Store notification state` wrote task 0198 (not 0193); `Load notification state` did not find existing 0193 row; classification: partial pinning / dynamic reference leakage, NOT confirmed pure idempotency bug |
| D-0202-A | **Pending** (batch 0199–0203, 2026-05-14) — controlled fully-pinned harness inspection/repair without Execute; design: `docs/automation/telegram-fully-pinned-validation-harness-design.md` |
| Idempotency design | Exists: `docs/automation/telegram-notifier-idempotency-state-store-implementation-design.md` |
| Idempotency checklist | Exists: `docs/automation/telegram-notifier-idempotency-implementation-checklist.md` |
| Runtime UI handoff | Exists: `docs/automation/telegram-idempotency-runtime-ui-handoff.md` (task 0183) |
| Data Table | `alina_telegram_notifier_state` — created and one row written (user report 2026-05-14) |
| Idempotency implementation | Done by user report (2026-05-14) — send/write test succeeded; three duplicate-skip validation attempts (D-0187-A, D-0193-A, D-0197-A) all failed to validate: D-0187-A/D-0193-A inconclusive (latest-done drift), D-0197-A not successful (partial pinning / dynamic reference leakage); requires fully-pinned harness with `$json.*` only |
| Token / chat id in repo | None |
| INBOX pending count | 1 (D-0202-A) |
| INBOX decided count | 15 (D-0197-A not successful, D-0193-A inconclusive, D-0187-A inconclusive) |
| Next step | User decision on D-0202-A: Option 1 (authorize controlled inspection/repair of TEST-only pinned workflow, no Execute), Option 2 (do not repair now), Option 3 (defer and refine design) |
