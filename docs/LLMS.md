# LLMS.md — Alina Lavoro Agent Entry Point

**For AI agents:** read this file first. It is derived memory (Level 2); canonical docs win on conflict.

**Compact constraint:** LLMS.md should stay below ~150 lines. If it grows beyond that, move older detail to `docs/wiki/current-state.md`, canonical docs, or `docs/history/PROJECT_LOG.md`. LLMS.md is an entry point, not a history file.

---

## Mandatory read order

1. `docs/LLMS.md`
2. `docs/wiki/current-state.md`
3. `docs/wiki/token-efficiency.md`
4. Assigned task file, if any
5. Only task-specific canonical docs

**Do not read by default:**
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` — fallback/audit only; justify if opened.
- `docs/CHECKPOINT.md` — restart context only; justify if opened.
- `docs/history/PROJECT_LOG.md` — audit only.

## Current App State

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Source version | **V2.1.1** (hotfix ready 2026-05-16; deploy pending) |
| Production version | **V2.1.0** @29 (live) |
| Tag | **`v2.0.1-stable`** (last stable; v2.1.1-stable pending post-deploy test) |
| Branch | **main** (`dev` legacy/inactive) |
| Apps Script deploy | **@29** (V2.1.0 live; V2.1.1 deploy pending task 0365) |
| Last manual test | **FAILED** (0362) — quick resume broken in V2.1.0; V2.1.1 hotfix prepared |
| App scope | **V2.1.1 source ready · quick resume fix · deploy pending 0365** |

---

## Active Workstream

**V2.1.1 hotfix** — quick resume persistence fix (`tryQuickResumeFromCache_`). Source ready; deploy pending (task 0365). After deploy: manual test (task 0366), then stable tag (task 0367).

Automation (watcher/runner/low-touch): **baseline stable / monitor** — Telegram Mode A active and stable-after-fix.

---

## Task State

| State | Info |
|---|---|
| Last completed | **0364** — V2.1.1 quick resume fix (2026-05-16): source fix + version bump; checks pass. |
| Batch completed | 0353–0361 (V2.1.0 analytics + deploy), 0362 (post-deploy test FAILED), 0364 (hotfix) |
| Queue | `docs/tasks/queue/0363-v21-stable-tag.md` (BLOCKED — 0362 failed; skip until 0366 passes) |
| Next | deploy V2.1.1 (task 0365 — manual deploy gate) |

## Low-Touch Stack Snapshot

| Component | Status | Pointer |
|---|---|---|
| n8n queue reader | Operational, scheduled polling validated | `docs/automation/n8n-workflows/queue-reader.md` |
| Telegram Mode A | **Active scheduled notification-only**, stable-after-fix | `docs/automation/telegram-mode-a-post-activation-monitoring-checklist.md` |
| INBOX | Active; **0 pending**, 21 decided, 1 superseded | `docs/INBOX.md` |
| Decision Packet format | Canonical for real decisions/gates only | `docs/automation/decision-packet-format.md` |
| LLM Wiki V3.1 | Active, but must stay subtractive/measure-first | `docs/wiki/` |
| Template Pack | Active; use core + task overlay + final report | `docs/tasks/templates/` |
| AGENTS.md | Pointer-only root entry | `AGENTS.md` |

## Automation Done Criteria

The automation phase is **sufficiently stable** when:
- Telegram Mode A is active and monitored;
- INBOX pending count is manageable;
- template-first policy is stable;
- no new runtime is required to remove current friction.

After that point, every new automation workstream must prove which manual friction it eliminates before it is opened.

---

## Future / Low Priority — Not Active Workstreams

- CLI Printing Press
- repo hygiene scanner/report-only
- local AI router / Ollama integration beyond documented feasibility
- browser bridge
- dual-agent loop
- VPS backup plan, n8n health check, INBOX auto-read, GitHub write automation

All remain gated/future unless the user explicitly opens them.

---

## Open Gates

Require explicit manual gate before action:
runtime, VPS/n8n UI, workflow import/export/Execute, Telegram send, Schedule change, provider API, billing, API key, login, GitHub Actions, deploy, tag, rollback, app source changes (`src/**`), secrets, OAuth material, real chat IDs, physical tests.

Provider APIs are out of scope by default. ChatGPT = web/on-demand; Claude Code/Cursor/Windsurf = supervised tools; Local AI = Ollama/local models.

---

## Implementers

| Implementer | Status | CLI capability |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | Principal supervised implementer (current) | Confirmed — batch/non-interactive |
| Cursor | **Future dual-agent target** (Agent 1 + Agent 2); suspended until reset | Interactive-only (v3.3.30; `agent` subcommand interactive) |
| Windsurf/Cascade | Fallback supervised tool; not an active verification target | CLI present, no agent mode (v1.110.1) |
| Antigravity | Fallback supervised tool; not an active verification target | Partially confirmed (`chat --mode agent` v1.107.0; headless unverified) |

Cursor-first decision: `docs/automation/dual-cli-orchestrator-lite-design.md` §1c · CLI capability matrix: §1b

## Update Rule

Update this file at task completion, but keep it compact. Move history out; keep only current state, latest task, active gates, and pointers.
